# Redis packaged for Immich Distribution

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is a in-memory key value database that I use in [Immich Distribution](https://github.com/nsg/immich-distribution). This repo is used as a dependency of the Immich Distribution project and is not intended for direct consumption.

## Usage

```yaml
stage-snaps:
    - immich-distribution-redis/latest/stable
```

## Contents

```
